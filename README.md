# Program 5:  Flowers Inc.

<p>The purpose of this  exercise is to create a program computes that contains multiple forms that  allow the user to find out what their favorite flower says about them, build  their own  <br />
  Bouquet and place their  final order.</p>
<p><strong>Form 1:</strong>  This form should be your main menu.  Give the user the opportunity to &lsquo;take the  quiz&rsquo; or &lsquo;build their bouquet&rsquo;.    Make sure to include an exit button here.</p>
<p><strong>Form 2:</strong>  This form should allow the user to take a  quiz to reveal what their favorite flower says about them.   You should take in the user&rsquo;s name (textbox) and provide the user with the option to choose only one type of flower  (radiobutton).   Output the user&rsquo;s name,  the name of flower selected, and the &lsquo;description&rsquo;.  Output a photo the selected flower too.  Make sure to add a clear button and a button  that takes the user back to the main menu.   Description text listed below.   </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Roses - You think with your heart and know how to  make a statement</em></li>
  <li><em>Tulips - You are thoughtful and confident and are  always coordinated.</em></li>
  <li><em>Daisies - You are an optimist who can find the good  in any bad situation.  </em></li>
  <li><em>Daffodils - You are fun and laid-back and always  put friends and family first</em></li>
  <li><em>Sunflowers - You love to be around people and make  new friends.</em></li>
  <li><em>Lilies - You are hard worker and proud of all you  accomplish.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Form 3:</strong>  This form should allow the user to build  their own bouquet.   Allow the user to  input the type of flower and quantity (inputbox), the accents (checkboxes), and  the type of container (radiobutton).    You must calculate the total order with tax. Make sure to include a  button called &lsquo;checkout&rsquo; that will take the user to form 4, a clear button and  a button to take the user back to the main menu.  Options listed below.</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="98%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%"><p><em>Flowers</em></p></td>
    <td width="33%"><p><em>Accents</em></p></td>
    <td width="33%"><p><em>Container</em></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="160" valign="top"><p>- Roses (2.80/flower) <br />
      - Daisies (2.00/flower) <br />
      - Hydrangeas (5.00/flower) <br />
      - Lily (3.00/flower)</p></td>
    <td width="160" valign="top"><p>- Mini Spray Roses (2.65)<br />
      - Baby's Breath (1.50)<br />
      - leather leaf fern (1.25)</p></td>
    <td width="160" valign="top"><p>- Vase (6.00)<br />
      - Mason Jar (4.00)<br />
      - Basket (8.00)</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Form 4:</strong>  This form will allow the user to  &lsquo;Checkout&rsquo;.  Allow the user to input  their first name, last name, and address.   Output this information to a listbox along with a summary of their order  from Form3 and the order total from Form3.     Include a button to go back to the main menu.  </p>
<h3>In this exercise, you will:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create  algorithms</li>
  <li>Work with  adding Controls to a Visual Basic Form</li>
  <li>Declare and  Assign values to Global Variables</li>
  <li>Use a Constant Variable</li>
  <li>Cast Inputs to appropriate data types</li>
  <li>Use arithmetic operations</li>
  <li>Use Decision making concepts</li>
  <li>Use checkboxes and radiobuttons</li>
  <li>Use textboxes to input information</li>
  <li>Use a listbox to output information</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Before your  Code, for each mini-program:  Create the  algorithm</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify inputs </li>
        <li>Identify the steps in your process </li>
        <li>Identify outputs </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a new Visual Basic Windows Forms Application  named &lsquo;FlowersInc&rsquo; and save it to your i:drive
  </li>
  <li>Design each form by adding the necessary controls.   Play with the control properties to change colors/backgrounds. Keep design consistent throughout all your forms.
  </li>
  <li>Write the code needed to perform required tasks for  each form as described above.  </li>
  <li>Spruce up your forms by adding pictureboxes with a  relevant images </li>
  <li>Save All,  Compile and Run Your Form</li>
  <li>Upload the completed  assignment to GitHub classroom.</li>
